In this project our team built an application that takes in site visitor traffic, compiles specific information and returns that to the user.

Information we compiled based on payload included:
* Most popular referrers
* Most popular HTTP Verbs
* Average response time
* Maximum/ Minimum response time
* List of most popular browsers used
* List of most popular operating systems
* List of most popular resolutions used

This information was also compiled for specific urls for a client. For example, in addition to statistics for visitors using an entire client's website, clients could look at a specific url on their site.
